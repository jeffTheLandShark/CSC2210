# CSC2210 - Procedural and Object-Oriented C++
## Overview
This repository contains lab work for the **CSC2210 - Procedural and Object-Oriented C++** course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (Fall 2024), instructed by Dr. Sohum Sohoni. The course focuses on the C++ programming language, relating the high-level computational model of C++ to its machine-level execution. 

## Learning Outcomes

The following was provided by the course syllabus:

- Write procedural C and C++ programs
- Explain how signed 2's complement and unsigned numbers, and floating point numbers are represented within a computer, and explain how that impacts performance
- Describe the transformation of code from a high-level language like C++ to machine-level instructions
- Describe the execution of a line of high-level code and flow of control in terms of interaction with the underlying hardware like the PC, registers, stack and the datapath
- Explain how variables are allocated in memory, the relationship between variables and pointers, and the scope and lifetime of variables
- Make use of argument passing by value, reference, and address
- Write object-oriented C++ programs making use of C++ operator overloading, polymorphism, and virtual vs. non-virtual methods
- Write robust C++ programs that use dynamic memory allocation
- Write robust C++ programs using template functions and the Standard Template Library
- Debug C and C++ implementations using a debugger
- Use preprocessor directives to conditionally compile source code and support project configuration
- Compare the C++ type system with other languages with respect to efficiency, reliability, and readability

### SPAs

| SPA   | Description                                                                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPA 1 | Implementing a program that keeps a running tally of intakes and output and flags when the differential is 1 liter or more. |
| SPA 2 | Implementing a "wordle helper" program that reads a dictionary file and finds words that match the user's input.            |
| SPA 3 | Implementing a program to read appointments and print them out in sorted order where appointments are sorted by date.       |
| SPA 4 | Implementing a spin on the classic text-based game "Hunt the Wumpus".                                                       |
| SPA 5 | Implementing a C version of SPA 1.                                                                                          |
